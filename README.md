# 31765 - Applied Statistics and Statistical Software
This repository is intended for the group assignments of the course '02441 - Applied Statistics and Statistical Software' at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It contains the R scripts and data for case 1 and 2. See the course [webpage](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2019-2020/02441) for further information.

## Program
The project is coded in [R version 3.6.2](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## Case 1 - Effect of hardness and detergent on enzymatic catalysis
The goal of this assignment was to describe and make inference about the enzymatic performance in the presence and absence of hardness and detergent. The following questions are answered with the statistical model:
  * How does hardness & detergent influence the catalytic activity?
  * Is the catalytic activity dependent on the amount of enzyme present?
  * Are there any differences in performance among the enzymes in this study regarding the factors mentioned above?
  * Are there indications of systematic errors due to one enzyme per experiment, how would this affect the model?

## Case 2 - Energy performance of buildings
The goal of this assignment was to perform appropriate statistical analysis to identify buildings which could most benfited from a retrofitting. The statistical model performed was an ANCOVA, followed by proper diagnostics and data visualization.
